Concrete slump measurements are used to [determine concrete properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_slump_test) before it sets. In this dataset measurements of other properties of a concrete mixture, such as water and cement content, are used to predict the concrete compressive strength and slump. [Two models are used to make predictions](https://leoespin.github.io/concrete_slump/), a decision-tree regression model and a random-forest model.
